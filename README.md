# PIC16F84-Code
Building a PIC16F84 model and Comparing its results to both PROTEUS and QSPICE.


Steps on How to run QSPICE 

1. Open the QSPICE PIC16F84
2. Click & Open PIC16F84.qsch
3. After that then Run Simulation Located at the Main X1 PIC16F84_MCU Top Left
4. Done now you just select the PORT wires on what you want to show on the simulation.

Other Steps (Changing Hex File to Run)
1. Right Click or Double Click X1 PIC16F84_MCU (Enter Schematic)
2. Right Click PIC16F84_X1_ROM then select Open Verilog Source
3. At the fopen code section change hex file you want to read then F5 to compile or Right Click then Compile
